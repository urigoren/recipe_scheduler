        "Place the pork chops on the preheated grill, and cook the chops until the surface is seared but the meat is just barely pink in the middle, about 5 minutes. Brush the chops with the glaze mixture, and flip to cook the glaze onto the meat. When the glazed side shows good grill marks, flip again, brush glaze onto the pork chops, flip, and grill until the other side shows nice brown grill marks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)."
