        "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.",

        "Grill the chops on the hottest part of the grill until lightly charred and crusty, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Move the chops to a cooler area of the grill, and continue to cook, brushing both sides generously with the honey-soy glaze, until chops are no longer pink inside, about 3 to 4 more minutes. The juices should run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
        "While chops are grilling, brush slices of onion with oil, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill onion slices until they are translucent and browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. To serve, place chops and onions on warmed plates, and brush the chops with the reserved honey-soy glaze."
