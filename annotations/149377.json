        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix rice and 3 cups of the water; spoon evenly onto center of each of six large sheets of heavy-duty foil. Top each with one chicken breast and 1/2 cup of the vegetables. Drizzle evenly with combined peanut butter, barbecue sauce, soy sauce and remaining 1/4 cup water.",
