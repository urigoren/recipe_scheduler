        "6 cups broccoli florets",
        "1 onion",
        "2 cups fat-skimmed beef broth",
        "2 tablespoons Chinese black bean and garlic sauce",

    "instructions": [
        "In a covered 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, bring 2 1/2 to 3 quarts water to a boil.",
        "Meanwhile, rinse broccoli. Trim stems and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then cut florets lengthwise into 1-inch pieces. Peel onion and cut into thin slivers. In a small bowl, mix broth, black bean sauce, and cornstarch.",
        "Add spaghetti to boiling water and cook, uncovered, until barely tender to bite, 6 to 9 minutes. Pour into a colander, rinse with hot water, and drain.",
        "Return pan to high heat and pour in oil. Add beef and stir often, breaking up with spoon, until lightly browned and crumbly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion and stir until it begins to brown, about 1 minute.",
        "Add broccoli and 1/2 cup water; cover and stir occasionally until bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir broth mixture, add to pan, and stir until boiling.",
